If you would like to see your code in the main project it MUST be tested.
If you find a bug, a test exposing the bug would be great.

= acts_as_indestructible

  acts_as_indestructible aims to be a working version
  of the acts_as_paranoid idea, which is to mark ActiveRecord objects
  as deleted instead of actually deleting them from the database.
  
  After an object is marked as deleted it should be excluded from
  all of the ActiveRecord method calls and act as if it
  was actually deleted from the database.
  
  It may also be desirable to have an additional optional parameter
  on finders to include deleted objects (ie. :include_deleted => true)
  for places that need to see deleted objects, like admin areas.
  
  Each overridden ActiveRecord method will be tested to make sure
  it behaves properly.
